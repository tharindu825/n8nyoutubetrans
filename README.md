🚀 Project Highlight: AI-Powered YouTube Transcription & Slack Automation with n8n

I'm thrilled to share my latest automation project where I’ve harnessed the power of n8n (self-hosted via Docker) to build an end-to-end workflow that transcribes YouTube videos and delivers summarized insights directly to Slack. 🧠💬

💡 What It Does:

🔄 Automated Workflow: Triggered via an RSS feed when new YouTube videos are published.

🎙️ Transcription: Audio is transcribed using the Supadata AI API — a fast and reliable transcription service.

🤖 AI Summarization & Guidance: Leveraging the power of Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, the transcribed content is intelligently summarized and refined into actionable insights.

📩 Slack Delivery: The final, summarized notes are automatically posted to my Slack channel using the Slack API for quick reference and team collaboration.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

n8n (Self-hosted with Docker) – Orchestrates the entire automation flow

Slack API – For seamless communication and real-time updates

RSS.app – Detects new YouTube uploads

Supadata AI – High-accuracy audio transcription

Google Gemini 2.5 Pro – AI-powered content summarization



This project is ideal for those who lack the time to watch full-length educational & important videos.
